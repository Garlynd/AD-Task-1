    <br><br><p class="text">
        Our cycling team, the Ineos Riders, was born in 2021 when four passionate cyclists — Mark, Peter, Lance, and Julian — met at a local charity ride.  
        What started as a casual weekend meetup quickly turned into a dedicated team with a shared goal: to push limits, explore new routes, and inspire others to ride.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        Over time, the Ineos Riders grew from a small group into a community hub for cyclists of all skill levels.  
        We now train together, compete in local races, and organize community events to promote healthy, active living.
        <br>Our mission is simple: *Ride hard. Ride together. Ride with purpose.*
